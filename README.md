# reed-frost-model-cost-minimization-using-neural-networks
This code was developed as an assignment for the Numerical Optimization and Stochastic Optimization course. The main task is to simulate the number of infected, susceptible and re-
moved over a population in order to find the optimal level of containment measures that minimizes costs. The problem can be viewed as a stochastic optimization problem and it is solved with the implementation of a Nonlinear Neural Network from scratch. A more detailed presentation of the project is reported inside S_Assignment_1_Grobbo_Civiero.pdf file.
